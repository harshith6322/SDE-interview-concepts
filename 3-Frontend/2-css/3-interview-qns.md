### **Basic CSS Questions**:

1. **What is the CSS Box Model?**

   - Explain the parts of the box model and how they affect the layout of an element (content, padding, border, margin).

2. **What is the difference between `class` and `id` selectors in CSS?**

   - When should you use each, and how does specificity affect the two?

3. **What is the difference between `inline`, `block`, and `inline-block` elements?**

   - How do these different display properties behave?

4. **How does CSS specificity work?**

   - Explain how browsers determine which styles to apply when multiple CSS rules target the same element.

5. **What is the difference between `absolute`, `relative`, `fixed`, and `sticky` positioning in CSS?**

   - Give examples of when each positioning property might be useful.

6. **What is the `z-index` in CSS, and how does it work?**

   - How does the stacking context affect elements in relation to their `z-index` values?

7. **What are pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in CSS?**

   - Explain the difference and provide examples (e.g., `:hover`, `:before`, `:after`).

8. **What are media queries, and how are they used in responsive design?**

   - Provide an example of a media query for a mobile-first design.

9. **What are the differences between `em`, `rem`, `px`, `vw`, and `vh` units in CSS?**

   - Explain when and why you would use each unit.

10. **What is the `float` property in CSS, and how does `clear` work with it?**
    - Why is `float` used, and how do you clear floated elements?

### **Intermediate CSS Questions**:

11. **What is Flexbox, and how does it help in layout design?**

    - Explain the main Flexbox properties (`justify-content`, `align-items`, `flex-direction`).

12. **Explain CSS Grid and how it differs from Flexbox.**

    - How does Grid layout work, and when would you use it over Flexbox?

13. **What is the difference between `max-width` and `min-width`?**

    - How do these properties behave in responsive design?

14. **What is `box-sizing: border-box`, and how does it differ from the default box model?**

    - Why is `border-box` preferred in many modern layouts?

15. **How do you create a CSS transition or animation?**

    - Provide examples of a CSS transition and keyframe animation.

16. **How does `position: sticky` work, and how is it different from `position: fixed`?**

    - Explain its use case in creating sticky headers or elements.

17. **Explain how `visibility: hidden` and `display: none` differ.**

    - When would you use one over the other?

18. **What are CSS variables (custom properties), and how do you use them?**

    - Provide an example of how to declare and use CSS variables.

19. **What are CSS preprocessors (like Sass or LESS), and how do they enhance CSS development?**

    - Explain features like nesting, variables, mixins, and inheritance.

20. **What is the difference between `hover` and `focus` states in CSS?**
    - How do these pseudo-classes work, especially for accessibility?

### **Advanced CSS Questions**:

21. **What are CSS selectors and combinators?**

    - Explain different types of selectors (e.g., descendant, child, adjacent sibling, general sibling).

22. **What is the `z-index` stacking context, and how can it affect element rendering?**

    - Explain how the stacking context is created and how it influences layout.

23. **How would you implement a responsive grid layout without using any CSS frameworks like Bootstrap?**

    - Explain how you'd handle responsiveness with pure CSS.

24. **What is the difference between `opacity` and `visibility` in CSS?**

    - How does each property affect interaction with the element?

25. **How do CSS transitions and animations affect performance, and how can you optimize them?**

    - Discuss how animations impact the rendering pipeline and techniques to reduce performance overhead (e.g., using `transform` instead of `left`, `top`).

26. **What is a CSS reset or normalizer, and why is it important?**

    - How do resets ensure consistency across different browsers?

27. **Explain the concept of the critical rendering path in CSS.**

    - How does CSS affect page performance and loading times?

28. **How do you handle cross-browser compatibility in CSS?**

    - What techniques or tools (e.g., vendor prefixes, CSS Grid fallback, polyfills) do you use to ensure consistent rendering across different browsers?

29. **What is BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology, and why is it used in CSS?**

    - Explain how BEM helps structure and organize CSS in large projects.

30. **How can you improve CSS performance in large web applications?**
    - Discuss techniques like inlining critical CSS, minification, reducing the number of rules, and limiting the use of selectors like `*`.

### **Practical CSS Tasks**:

Interviewers may also ask you to solve live coding or whiteboard problems, such as:

1. **Create a responsive navigation menu** that collapses into a hamburger menu on smaller screens using Flexbox or Grid.
2. **Center a div vertically and horizontally** using modern CSS techniques like Flexbox or Grid.

3. **Build a card layout** that is responsive using CSS Grid and Flexbox, with some elements having different sizes (like a masonry grid).

4. **Create a CSS-only tooltip** that appears on hover with a smooth transition effect.e

5. **Style an accessible button** that has focus states and adjusts based on screen sizes.

These questions and exercises will test your ability to apply CSS concepts practically and to think critically about layout, styling, and performance in a real-world setting. Practicing these will give you a solid foundation for an SDE role involving front-end development.
