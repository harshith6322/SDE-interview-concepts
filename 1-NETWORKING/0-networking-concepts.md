Here's a breakdown of key networking concepts you should focus on for your revision:

### **1. Basics of Networking:**
   - **IP Addressing:**
     - IPv4 vs IPv6
     - Public vs Private IP addresses
     - Subnetting and CIDR notation
   - **MAC Addressing:**
     - What is a MAC address?
     - Difference between MAC and IP addresses
   - **DNS (Domain Name System):**
     - How DNS works
     - A, AAAA, CNAME, MX records
     - DNS resolution process

### **2. Network Models:**
   - **OSI Model:**
     - 7 layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application
     - Functions of each layer
     - Protocols associated with each layer
   - **TCP/IP Model:**
     - 4 layers: Network Interface, Internet, Transport, Application
     - Comparison with OSI model

### **3. Protocols:**
   - **TCP vs UDP:**
     - Connection-oriented vs Connectionless protocols
     - Use cases for each
     - Handshake process in TCP (3-way handshake)
   - **HTTP/HTTPS:**
     - How they work
     - Differences between HTTP and HTTPS
     - SSL/TLS and how they secure data
   - **FTP, SFTP, SSH:**
     - File transfer protocols and their differences
   - **SMTP, POP3, IMAP:**
     - Email protocols and their purposes

### **4. Networking Devices:**
   - **Router vs Switch vs Hub:**
     - Functions and differences
   - **Firewalls:**
     - Purpose and types (e.g., stateful vs stateless)
   - **Load Balancers:**
     - Types of load balancing (e.g., round-robin, least connections)
   - **Gateways, Proxy Servers, NAT:**
     - Their roles in a network

### **5. Network Security:**
   - **VPN (Virtual Private Network):**
     - How VPNs work
     - Types of VPNs (e.g., site-to-site, remote access)
   - **Firewalls and IDS/IPS:**
     - Intrusion detection and prevention systems
     - Stateful vs Stateless firewalls
   - **Network Encryption:**
     - Symmetric vs Asymmetric encryption
     - Common encryption protocols (e.g., AES, RSA)
   - **DDoS Protection:**
     - How DDoS attacks work
     - Methods of protection and mitigation

### **6. Advanced Networking Concepts:**
   - **CDN (Content Delivery Network):**
     - How CDNs work
     - Benefits of using a CDN
   - **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol):**
     - Basics of BGP and its role in routing
   - **NAT (Network Address Translation):**
     - How NAT works
     - Types of NAT (e.g., SNAT, DNAT, PAT)
   - **SDN (Software-Defined Networking):**
     - Concepts and benefits of SDN
   - **Cloud Networking:**
     - How networking works in cloud environments
     - Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), Subnets, and Route Tables

### **7. Practical Networking Tools:**
   - **Ping and Traceroute:**
     - How to use them for network diagnostics
   - **Wireshark:**
     - Basics of packet analysis
   - **Netcat (nc):**
     - Uses for networking tasks and diagnostics
   - **Curl/Wget:**
     - Tools for making HTTP requests from the command line

These topics will give you a strong foundation in networking, which is crucial for both system design and full-stack development. Do you want to dive deeper into any specific area, or would you like some practice questions or real-world scenarios?
