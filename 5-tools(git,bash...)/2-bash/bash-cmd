---Bash-cmd---
The commands you've listed for Windows are also applicable in Ubuntu with the same or very similar syntax. Here's a breakdown of those commands and a few additional ones that might be useful for Ubuntu:

### Basic Commands (Same in Ubuntu)

1. **pwd** - Prints the path of the current working directory.
2. **cd** - Changes directories. `cd ..` moves one step back, and `cd ../..` moves two steps back.
3. **ls** - Lists files and directories in the current directory. Flags:
   - `-l`: Detailed list
   - `-R`: Recursive listing (shows subdirectories)
   - `-a`: Shows hidden files
   - `-la`: Combines detailed list with hidden files
4. **mkdir** - Creates a new directory.
5. **touch** - Creates a new file, e.g., `touch index.html`.
6. **cat** - Displays the contents of a file. Use `>` or `>>` to write to a file.
7. **rm** - Removes files or directories. Flags:
   - `-r`: Recursively removes directories
   - `-f`: Forces removal without confirmation
8. **vi** (or **vim** in Ubuntu) - Text editor. Use `i` to insert, `ESC` to exit insert mode, and `:wq` to save and exit.
9. **mv** - Moves or renames files or directories.
10. **cp** - Copies files or directories. Use `-r` to copy directories.
11. **dir**- directory

### Additional Useful Ubuntu Commands

1. **sudo** - Runs a command with superuser (root) privileges. Example: `sudo apt update`.
2. **apt-get** (or **apt**) - Package manager for Ubuntu.
   - `sudo apt-get update`: Updates package lists.
   - `sudo apt-get upgrade`: Upgrades all packages.
   - `sudo apt-get install package-name`: Installs a package.
3. **df** - Displays disk space usage. `df -h` shows it in a human-readable format.
4. **du** - Displays disk usage of files and directories. `du -sh *` shows the size of all items in the current directory.
5. **chmod** - Changes file permissions. Example: `chmod +x script.sh` makes a script executable.
6. **chown** - Changes file ownership. Example: `sudo chown user:group file`.
7. **ps** - Displays currently running processes. `ps aux` shows all processes.
8. **kill** - Terminates a process by its ID. Example: `kill 1234`.
9. **grep** - Searches text within files. Example: `grep "text" file.txt`.
10. **find** - Searches for files and directories. Example: `find / -name filename`.
11. **head** / **tail** - Displays the beginning or end of a file. Example: `head -n 10 file.txt` shows the first 10 lines.
12. **echo** - Displays a line of text or outputs it to a file. Example: `echo "Hello, World!" > hello.txt`.

These commands will help you navigate and manage files and directories in Ubuntu effectively. Most of them are directly applicable to other Linux distributions as well.






///shell -scripting




That's great! Shell scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks and managing systems. Hereâ€™s a roadmap to help you get started with shell scripting.

### 1. **Understand the Basics of the Shell**
   - **What is a Shell?**: A shell is a command-line interpreter that allows you to interact with the operating system.
   - **Popular Shells**: Bash (Bourne Again Shell), Zsh, Ksh, Fish. Bash is the most common, especially in Linux systems.

### 2. **Getting Started with Shell Commands**
   - Learn basic shell commands like:
     - `ls` (list directory contents)
     - `cd` (change directory)
     - `pwd` (print working directory)
     - `cp`, `mv`, `rm` (file operations)
     - `mkdir`, `rmdir` (create/remove directories)
     - `cat`, `echo`, `less`, `grep` (display and search content)
     - `chmod`, `chown` (file permissions)
   
   - Practice running these commands in a terminal to get comfortable with navigating and managing files.

### 3. **First Shell Script**
   Start with a simple shell script.

#### Example: Hello World
   1. Open a text editor (like `nano` or `vim`) and create a script file:
      ```bash
      nano hello.sh
      ```

   2. Write the script:
      ```bash
      #!/bin/bash
      echo "Hello, World!"
      ```

   3. Save and exit the file. Then make the script executable:
      ```bash
      chmod +x hello.sh
      ```

   4. Run the script:
      ```bash
      ./hello.sh
      ```

   This is your first shell script!

### 4. **Variables in Shell Scripts**
   Learn how to define and use variables in shell scripts.

#### Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
name="John"
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

- **Environment variables** like `$PATH`, `$HOME`, etc., are also important. You can view them with:
  ```bash
  echo $PATH
  ```

### 5. **Conditionals**
   Shell scripts can use `if-else` conditions to handle logic.

#### Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
if [ -f /etc/passwd ]; then
  echo "File exists"
else
  echo "File does not exist"
fi
```

### 6. **Loops**
   Loops are essential for repetitive tasks.

#### Example: `for` loop
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5
do
  echo "Number: $i"
done
```

#### Example: `while` loop
```bash
#!/bin/bash
counter=1
while [ $counter -le 5 ]
do
  echo "Counter: $counter"
  ((counter++))
done
```

### 7. **Functions in Shell Scripts**
   Functions help you reuse code and make your script modular.

#### Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
greet() {
  echo "Hello, $1!"
}

greet "Alice"
greet "Bob"
```

### 8. **Redirection and Piping**
   Learn how to use redirection to send output to files or other commands.

- **Redirect output** to a file:
  ```bash
  echo "This will go into a file" > output.txt
  ```

- **Piping**: Send the output of one command as input to another:
  ```bash
  ls | grep ".txt"
  ```

### 9. **Working with Arguments**
   You can pass arguments to your script using `$1`, `$2`, etc.

#### Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "First argument: $1"
echo "Second argument: $2"
```

Running the script with arguments:
```bash
./script.sh arg1 arg2
```

### 10. **Common Built-in Commands**
   - **`read`**: To get input from the user:
     ```bash
     echo "Enter your name:"
     read name
     echo "Hello, $name!"
     ```
   - **`exit`**: To terminate a script.
   - **`trap`**: To handle signals (useful for clean-up tasks when the script is interrupted).

### 11. **Error Handling**
   Use exit codes (`$?`) to check if a command succeeded or failed.

#### Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
mkdir new_dir
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "Directory created successfully"
else
  echo "Failed to create directory"
fi
```

### 12. **Advanced Topics**
   - **Case Statements**: Like switch statements in other languages.
   - **Cron Jobs**: Automate your scripts by scheduling them with cron.
   - **Array Handling**: Learn to use arrays for storing multiple values.
   - **File Manipulation**: Use `sed`, `awk`, and `grep` for complex text processing.
   - **Regex**: Master regular expressions for pattern matching.
