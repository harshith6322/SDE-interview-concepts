### Basic Commands (Same in Ubuntu)

3. **ls** - Lists files and directories in the current directory. Flags:
   - `-l`: Detailed list
   - `-R`: Recursive listing (shows subdirectories)
   - `-a`: Shows hidden files
   - `-la`: Combines detailed list with hidden files
4. **mkdir** - Creates a new directory.
5. **touch** - Creates a new file, e.g., `touch index.html`.
6. **cat** - Displays the contents of a file. Use `>` or `>>` to write to a file.
7. **rm** - Removes files or directories. Flags:
   - `-r`: Recursively removes directories
   - `-f`: Forces removal without confirmation
8. **vi** (or **vim** in Ubuntu) - Text editor. Use `i` to insert, `ESC` to exit insert mode, and `:wq` to save and exit.
9. **mv** - Moves or renames files or directories.
10. **cp** - Copies files or directories. Use `-r` to copy directories.
11. **dir**- directory

### Additional Useful Ubuntu Commands

   - `sudo apt-get update`: Updates package lists.
   - `sudo apt-get upgrade`: Upgrades all packages.
   - `sudo apt-get install package-name`: Installs a package.
3. **df** - Displays disk space usage. `df -h` shows it in a human-readable format.
4. **du** - Displays disk usage of files and directories. `du -sh *` shows the size of all items in the current directory.
5. **chmod** - Changes file permissions. Example: `chmod +x script.sh` makes a script executable.
6. **chown** - Changes file ownership. Example: `sudo chown user:group file`.
7. **ps** - Displays currently running processes. `ps aux` shows all processes.
8. **kill** - Terminates a process by its ID. Example: `kill 1234`.
9. **grep** - Searches text within files. Example: `grep "text" file.txt`.
10. **find** - Searches for files and directories. Example: `find / -name filename`.
11. **head** / **tail** - Displays the beginning or end of a file. Example: `head -n 10 file.txt` shows the first 10 lines.
12. **echo** - Displays a line of text or outputs it to a file. Example: `echo "Hello, World!" > hello.txt`.

These commands will help you navigate and manage files and directories in Ubuntu effectively. Most of them are directly applicable to other Linux distributions as well.
